        "Modern AI systems routinely process sensitive user data — including names, emails, phone numbers, government IDs, and financial identifiers. Ensuring that this data is **never leaked**, **never embedded**, and **never exposed** in model outputs is fundamental to responsible AI engineering.\n",
